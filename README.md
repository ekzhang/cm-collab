# cm-collab

Basic demo app for a [collaborative](https://codemirror.net/examples/collab/)
Markdown editor based on CodeMirror, communicating with a Node.js backend server
over WebSocket.

Supports a single document, with live cursors. Based on CodeMirror's operational
transformation extension. All other control and communication logic is handled
by the server, fully customizable to suit the needs of an application.

An experiment by [Eric Zhang](https://www.ekzhang.com/).
